# Identifying strong predictors of breast cancer recurrence

We explored to use a logistic regression model to identify strong predictors of breast cancer recurrence. Based on the feature weights assigned in the model, we found that degrees of malignancy are very strong predictors of breast cancer recurrence. The other two predictors, including being in the age 60-69 group and having cancer in the right-up of the breast quadrants, are also among the top five features with the highest absolute weight values. Our model didn't perform well on unseen data, with a fair accuracy score of `r scores$accuracy[2]` and a low recall score of `r scores$recall[2]`. The low recall score is likely due to the data imbalance problem noticed in the training data set. If time permits, we would like to explore some advanced methods to handle the imbalanced data situation and try some advanced feature selection methods to build a better model.

The breast cancer data set was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository [@Dua2019] and can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer). The data set looks at the recurrence and non-recurrence of breast cancer based on 9 features, including groups of age, menopause time, tumor size, ranges of the number of axillary lymph nodes, presence of node in cap, degree of malignancy, breast type, breast quadrant, and whether the patient used radiation therapy. The data set contains 286 instances with missing values.

## Usage

There are two suggested ways to run this analysis:

#### 1. Using Docker
*note - the instructions in this section also depends on running this in a unix shell (e.g., terminal or Git Bash)*

To replicate the analysis, install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started), clone/download this repository, use the command line to navigate to the root of this project on your computer, and then type the following (filling in PATH_ON_YOUR_COMPUTER with the absolute path to the root of this project on your computer).

```
docker run --rm -v PATH_ON_YOUR_COMPUTER:/home/DSCI_522_Group_301 clsu123/dsci-522-group-301 make -C '/home/DSCI_522_Group_301' all
```

To reset the repo to a clean state, with no intermediate or results files, run the following command:

```
docker run --rm -v PATH_ON_YOUR_COMPUTER:/home/DSCI_522_Group_301 clsu123/dsci-522-group-301 make -C '/home/DSCI_522_Group_301' clean
```

#### 2. Without using Docker

To replicate the analysis, clone this GitHub repository, install the [dependencies](#dependencies) listed below, and run the following commands at the command line/terminal from the root directory of this project:

```
make all
```

To reset the repo to a clean state, with no intermediate or results files, run the following command at the command line/terminal from the root directory of this project:

```
make clean
```
